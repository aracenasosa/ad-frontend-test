# Game Shop

A simple e-commerce app for browsing and buying video games. Built this to practice with Next.js 15 and React 19, focusing on creating a smooth user experience with filtering, pagination, and a clean UI.

## What's Inside

- Game catalog with static data (30 games for now)
- Filter games by genre
- Pagination to browse through all games
- Shopping cart page (basic setup)
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Loading states for better UX

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action.

## Notes

The game data is hardcoded in the codebase - no database or external API calls. Just static data to keep things simple and focus on the frontend implementation.
